;-- Fuses -----------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Old fuses for internal RC oscillator at 8MHz were lfuse=0xa4 hfuse=0xdf,
; but since we now set OSCCAL to 0xff (about 16MHz), running under 4.5V is
; officially out of spec. We'd better set the brown-out detection to 4.0V.
; The resulting code works with or without external 16MHz oscillators.
; Boards with external oscillators can use lfuse=0x3f.
;
; If the boot loader is enabled, the last nibble of the hfuse should be set
; to 'a' or '2' to also enable EESAVE - save EEPROM on chip erase. This is
; a 512-word boot flash section (0xe00), and enable BOOTRST to jump to it.
; Setting these fuses actually has no harm even without the boot loader,
; since 0xffff is nop, and it will just nop-sled around into normal code.
;
; Suggested fuses with 4.0V brown-out voltage:
; Without external oscillator: avrdude -U lfuse:w:0x24:m -U hfuse:w:0xda:m
;    With external oscillator: avrdude -U lfuse:w:0x3f:m -U hfuse:w:0xca:m
;
; Don't set WDTON if using the boot loader. We will enable it on start.
